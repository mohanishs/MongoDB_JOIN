This file is a template. It is copied to build/test/test-single.xml if a single class test is run.

Single object tests are easier to use during development when working on a specific section of
the driver.

To run tests in a single object type:

ant test-single -Dclass.name=org.bson.BSONTest

The previous example runs all the tests in org.bson.BSONTest
